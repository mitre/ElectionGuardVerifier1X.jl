This module provides data structures and operations used to report
verification answers.  At the top-level, there is a verification
record.  It identifies the specification version, the election, and
contains a list of verification answers.  A verification answer is the
result of checking all or part of a verification step as defined in an
ElectionGuard specification.

A verification answer contains a verification step number, a string
listing items that failed while verifying the step, the step title, a
comment, the number of records checked, and the number of records that
failed.  A failing step that has no items is marked using item "X".

In the verification routies, each verification item check returns an
integer.  The integer is zero if the check passes, otherwise it is an
integer with one bit set.  The bit is used to identify the item being
checked.  The bit patterns are exported as constants A, B, C, D, E, F,
G, H, I, J, and K.  The bit patterns for multiple checks are combined
using bitwise or.
